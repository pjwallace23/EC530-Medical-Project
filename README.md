# EC530-Medical-Project
A full stack application focused on database, API and UX implementation


# Branching Strategy
For this project I will use 2 branches: a test branch and a main branch. In the test branch I will implement a workflow through github actions that will run all my unit tests upon each push. Since my project will be done in Python, this will use Pytest. I will use flake8 as my linter. The main branch will only contain modules that have successfully been tested and debugged, and are ready for deployment.
